# MODULE-12
This is my Module 12 Challenge: NoSQL
##
This project involves working with data from the UK Food Standards Agency, where we analyze food establishment hygiene ratings and other related information. The data is stored in a NoSQL MongoDB database. The project tasks included setting up the database, performing CRUD operations, and conducting exploratory analysis using PyMongo and Pandas.
##
This challenge wasn't too difficult all things considered, but I did have a lot of trouble making sure my MongoDB was installed correctly and added to my path. Once I finally figured that out, I found the challenge very similar to some class activities we had done, so I was able to complete it based on those. 
##
In my code in a markdown file, I have included the line of code to import the JSON file into MongoDB. That is the step that was giving me major issues, so I hope it works well for you!
##
The code is located in the main directory, and the data is located in the 'Resources' folder. 
##
Thank you for taking the time to grade my assignment and I hope you have a great day!!
